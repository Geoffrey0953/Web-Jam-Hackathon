A joint inspection was conducted with M. Godoy, REHS.\nThe scope of work was a remodel of the bar area without plan approval.\nSee corrections below observed during the inspection:\n1) The installed flooring is not an approved flooring however it is approved on a performance basis. If the flooring is no longer smooth or in good \nrepair, it may be subject to replacement. Submit a sample to this office prior to installation.\n2) There is no base cove at the bar area. Provide an approved top-set base cove.\n3) The ice machine at the bar area is not sanitation listed. Replace with a sanitation listed ice machine. Ensure the ice machine is indirectly draining \nto a floor sink within 15 feet of the ice machine.\n4) Elevate drain lines for the draft cooler so they are at least 6\" off the floor.\n5) Enclose the end of the flex drain lines in a rigid line such as PVC or copper. Ensure drain line has a 1\" air gap from the rim of the floor sink.\n6) Mount 3-compartment sink to the wall.\n7) Provide a dump sink in the bar area. Ensure the dump sink is indirectly draining to a floor sink within 15 feet of the sink.\n8) Seal the gaps underneath the bar top.\n9) Raw wood was noted at the underside of bar top. Seal/finish with an approved finish such as semi-gloss paint or FRP.\n10) Remove foam from the copper piping. Ensure that equipment is smooth, durable and easily cleanable.\n11) Elevate all equipment (e.g. chest cooler, keg cooler) so they are on 6\" legs or caster wheels.\n12) Provide FRP or other water-resistant finish behind the three-compartment sink.\n13) Acquire any applicable city building permits for new plumbing. \n14) The bar-top does not meet the sneeze protection requirements. The bar-top must protect the largest food equipment behind the bar top (e.g. \n3-compartment sink) from contamination. Widen the bar-top in these areas with a scupper rail or other similar type of equipment to provide adequate \ncoverage. \nA reinspection has been scheduled for 2/14/23 to verify corrections.\n*The facility was observed a new pizza oven that was installed partially outside the hood ventilation system.
